                        Millions of people cross the oceans and land in order to reach Europe, fleeing their homes and the dire situations there in search of safety and comfort. While reaching their destination is a great accomplishment but they are still far away from settlement and stability, they have to integrate into the new society of the host country.

                        Our platform “Helping Hands” provides humanitarian migrants in Germany with help &amp; support to ensure a smoother process of integration –to enable them to contribute to their new host countries - as workers, as taxpayers, and as consumers.
